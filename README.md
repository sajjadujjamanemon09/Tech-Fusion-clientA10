## Here added some bullet points of this Project:

âž¤  *User Authentication and Authorization*: Users can sign up and log in using valid email and password.
        Passwords must meet security requirements, including uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and symbol characters.

âž¤  *Dynamic Navigation Bar*: The navigation bar displays three routes:- `Home`, `Add Products` and `My Cart`.
        It includes a brand `logo` on the left and a dynamic `login/logout` button on the right.

âž¤  *Homepage Banner*: The homepage features a visually appealing banner with the Tech title and a background image related to the Technology.

âž¤  *Brand Names*: There are six dynamically generated brand cards on the homepage.
        Each card shown has a `'Image & Brand Name'`.

âž¤  *Contact Us Section*: The `Contact Us` section provides information about the services offered, the organization's mission, and what they provide to users.

âž¤  *Private Routes and Access Control*: Certain routes, such as `Add Products`, `My Cart`, and `Products` are private and only accessible to authenticated users.
        Unauthorized users attempting to access private routes are redirected to the login page.

âž¤  *Sweet Alert Notifications*: Users receive alert notifications for successful sign-in and login actions.
        Successful login results in a alert indicating a successful login, while incorrect credentials trigger a notification.
