➤  *Dynamic Navigation Bar*: The navigation bar displays three routes:- `Home`, `Add Products` and `My Cart`.
        It includes a brand `logo` on the left and a dynamic `login/logout` button on the right.

➤  *Homepage Banner*: The homepage features a visually appealing banner with the Tech title and a background image related to the Technology.

➤  *Brand Names*: There are four dynamically generated brand cards on the homepage.
        Each card shown has a `'Image & Brand Name'`.

➤  *Contact Us Section*: The `Contact Us` section provides information about the services offered, the organization's mission, and what they provide to users.

➤  *Private Routes and Access Control*: Certain routes, such as `Add Products`, `My Cart`, and `Products` are private and only accessible to authenticated users.
        Unauthorized users attempting to access private routes are redirected to the login page.

        Successful login results in a alert indicating a successful login, while incorrect credentials trigger a notification.
